### Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the operator audits from the evidence.** The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. Run `playbooks/prototype.md` for each. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the screenshots for Appendix A. Ask the operator only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options (the **never-block-on-the-human** principle skill).
3. Explore in subagents with `task prompt: read and follow the poteto-agent instructions bundled with this plugin` and an explicit model per the Subagents section (the **guard-the-context-window** principle skill). Each returns file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points. No inlined dumps.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Unless the operator names a path, write the file under `<repo>/.codex/pstack-runs/<run-name>/docs/`. Keep every heading and every sub-block in the order shown. One section per PR. One PR is one change with its own evidence (the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill). Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**. Pick between `playbooks/autopilot-full.md` and `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md` per the rule at the end of `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md`. A standing program takes `playbooks/orchestrate.md`.
5. Write under `$technical-writing` in full, then `$unslop`. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Run `node <plugin-root>/skills/poteto-mode/scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>` and fix every line it prints (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill).
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the script's output, then stop. Execution starts on the operator's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked (the **prove-it-works** principle skill). That sentence is the verification rule. Every verification block opens with it. The live block is mandatory. Ten lanes on `gpt-6.1-sol` at the PR head drive the real surface through its control skill, per the **swarm** skill. Each lane is one box with a concrete scenario, the screenshot it saves, and its pass predicate. One lane is the **Regression lane against trunk.** It runs the same load-bearing scenario on trunk and head. If trunk does not have the feature, the lane records that fact and gates the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for instead of inventing a trunk result. The perf gate is dual-sided. Trunk and head must both produce the named metric. If trunk lacks the feature, also isolate the work the diff adds and set an absolute budget for that work plus the end-to-end state the user waits for. Do not claim a ratio between unlike scenarios. The perf block names the metric, the interleaved probe, the trunk baseline measured first, and the rule with the number that fails. A PR that changes an interaction is review-gated. The operator reviews it in chat with screenshots and a video before merge. A PR that changes no interaction writes `**Review gate.** None. <PR id> is not review-gated.` and no boxes under it.

The model shown in the skeleton is the default, not a pin. Replace it with the resolved `swarm workers` configuration from CODEX.md, including the effort in the owner brief. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, name that choice in the plan and omit spawn overrides.

**Control skill.** Pick it by surface. Browser, Electron, and web UIs use the available Codex browser or computer-use skill. CLIs and TUIs use terminal tools or a project verification skill. Native mobile uses whatever simulator-driving skill the repo has. A PR that touches two surfaces gets lanes on both. A surface with no control skill is a risk in Appendix C, and its live block still names how each lane drives it.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `<plugin-root>/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] On the operator's go, save the durable program objective with this exact text. Create a Codex goal only if the operator explicitly requests one. "<The plan path, the PR ids in order, the verification rule, who merges, and the done condition.>"
- [ ] Read the workflow files from the installed pstack plugin at program start. Re-read them at every tick. Resolve the project control skill from the current trunk separately.
  - [ ] `<plugin-root>/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`
  - [ ] `<plugin-root>/skills/swarm/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] `git show origin/main:<control skill path>`
  - [ ] `<plugin-root>/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`
  - [ ] `<plugin-root>/skills/<each other leaf skill the program uses>`
- [ ] Arm the hourly audit tick. In a local session, a Codex heartbeat automation. Where scheduling is unavailable, save a resume capsule and report that no future wake is armed. Never leave the cadence to memory.
- [ ] Use this tick prompt, verbatim. "Re-read the installed execution playbook and the durable program objective (and the Codex goal when explicitly requested). Audit the operation against both and fix drift in this tick. Probe every active lane and judge progress by side effects only. Stand down a stuck lane and dispatch its replacement now. Then post a status message to the operator only for tracked changes not already reported, such as a PR opened, a new code-ready head, a round or verdict, a merge, a stuck agent and the action taken, a blocker added or cleared, or a decision the operator must make. Name those changes only. Do not repeat the queue table, merged list, or unchanged blockers. Stay quiet if nothing changed. Log the tick and what it reported, or none, in the decision trail."
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Resolve the forge once. Default to `gh`; if `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, use `origin pr` for every PR operation. Record any fallback to `gh`. Never require `gt`.
- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, per **Opening a PR**. Use a built-in PR tool for operations it supports, otherwise use `origin pr create --status open --base <base-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <base-branch>` according to the resolved forge. A stack child targets its parent branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run `a focused diff-cleanup pass` before each commit and `$no-comments` before review.
- [ ] Triage every Bugbot and security-reviewer comment per `../references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before the code-ready report and babysit. Keep that merge base in fix rounds. Rebase again only at merge prep, on a `git merge-tree` conflict with trunk, or on a CI failure that comes from a change on trunk.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] At the merge-ready head SHA, run the swarm per `<plugin-root>/skills/swarm/SKILL.md`. One gates lane. The ten live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf lane from its **Verify, perf** block. One audit lane that reads the diff and the receipts and distrusts the PR body.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner. A new head gets a fresh swarm and a fresh verdict.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs at the PR head in its own worktree when it writes. Run the ten lanes in capacity-bounded waves, and serialize shared browser or simulator state; Codex does not provision a VM per lane. Drive through the applicable Codex browser, computer-use, terminal, or project verification skill.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the control skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every screenshot to `/tmp/swarm-<pr-id>/worker-<n>/<slug>.png` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. Ten lanes on `gpt-6.1-sol` at the PR head, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. Regression lane against trunk. Run <the same load-bearing scenario> at trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that and gate <the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for>. Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 3. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.

- [ ] Lane 9. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 10. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change in the lane's verification environment. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the operator's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Bugbot triage done.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the root appends it to the base-branch stack and the operator lands it bottom-up.>
