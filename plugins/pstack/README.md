# pstack

An independent Codex-native adaptation of [Lauren Tan's pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack), distributed under its MIT license. The workflow philosophy and guide below are adapted from upstream; this port is not an official Cursor or OpenAI plugin.

there's a growing sense that ai writes too much slop code. i agree. i don't want to ship like a team of twenty slop artists. throughput without quality is not a goal i aspire to. if you want to go fast, go deep first.

**pstack is my answer.** these are Lauren Tan's engineering skills, ported from the official Cursor plugin to Codex. the goal is not to maximize loc. pstack helps you write less, higher-quality code.

**pstack gives you fearless parallelism.** when you can go deep on one agent and trust it to write good, verifiable code, you can truly parallelize with confidence. start multiple agents up with `poteto-mode` and trust that they'll apply rigorous engineering principles to their work.

**codex gives you the best of all worlds.** pstack routes independent work through Codex subagents and can assign different models and reasoning efforts by role.

fork it. improve it. make it yours. PRs are welcome!

## install

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/pstack-codex
codex plugin add pstack@pstack-codex
```

Clone the pstack-codex repository first, or run its `scripts/install.sh`. Start a new Codex task after installation. Personas are loaded from bundled instructions; optional custom-agent templates are not automatically registered by the plugin manifest. See [the runtime contract](CODEX.md) for host prerequisites and behavioral differences.

## get started

two steps:

1. run [`$setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md), pick a reasoning budget, and choose which models you want.
2. use [`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) whenever you're doing anything that requires rigor.

new here? the [pstack guide](./docs/guide/README.md) walks you through a first real task, from setup and prompting through verification and overnight runs.

that's it. the other skills are situational; the mode skill uses them as needed. out of the box, implementation, exploration, explanation, and tooling review use gpt-6.1-sol. deep reflection and the hardest judgment use gpt-6-astra. design and review panels default to one agent on each model. [`$setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) changes any role and panel size.

## usage

use [`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task. it reads your request, picks from a set of playbooks, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.

### just use [`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md)

this skill is the main shortcut. i use it whenever i need the agent to do rigorous engineering work. it comes with twenty-three playbooks:

```
$poteto-mode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even when idle. repro
first, then fix and verify.
```

```
$poteto-mode i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want everything merged by
morning.
```

</details>



when invoked it:

1. matches your task to a [playbook](./skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/) and opens a todo list whose first items are its steps, copied in verbatim.
2. routes to the other skills as the steps fire.
3. writes unslopped replies framed for the consumer and the maintainer.

the full rules and playbooks live in [`skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md).

Ask Codex to use poteto-mode throughout the task. This is a standing task instruction, retained in resume notes; Codex does not support Cursor mode/reminder metadata or automatic activation across unrelated tasks.

[`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) works with Codex goals, heartbeat automations, and bounded monitoring loops for long-running work.

## skills

[`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) runs most of these for you when a step needs them (`how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `unslop`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, `tdd`, and the principles). the table below is for when you want one directly:

```
$how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
```

```
$interrogate review this pr.

### examples

mostly i type [`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task and let it route to a playbook. the other skills fire as the steps need them. a few i reach for directly.

bug fix:           $poteto-mode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even

## the `poteto-agent` and Comment Sicko subagents

pstack ships a `poteto-agent` custom agent that runs the style end to end. it reads `poteto-mode` in full, including the inline principles index, before doing work.

[`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) and the [`poteto-agent`](./agents/poteto-agent.md) route through the same wrapper.

pstack also ships [Comment Sicko](./agents/comment-sicko.md), a read-only custom agent. usually invoke it through [`$no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md), not directly.

## principles

twenty-three short skills, one principle each. `poteto-mode` indexes them inline and reads that index at task start. the standalone files are there so other skills can reference a principle by name, and so the index can point at the full rule for each.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-three principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [attack-the-premise](./skills/principle-attack-the-premise/SKILL.md) | core | Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Take a census of which actors hold the imbalance before the next fix, then question the premise instead of writing another fix that assumes it. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, refuse to lie to the compiler, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom to its root cause and fix it there; reproduce first, ask why until you reach it, resist nil-check guards that silence crashes. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [test-behavior-not-implementation](./skills/principle-test-behavior-not-implementation/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply when you write, change, or keep a test. Call the code the way its users do and assert the result they observe against a literal expected value. If the test would still pass when every imported function returns undefined, rewrite the assertion or delete the test. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## codex integrations

pstack uses Codex's built-in `skill-creator`, subagent collaboration tools, browser, computer-use, terminal, goals, and automations when available. the diff-cleanup workflow is expressed directly, so no companion plugin is required. `why` discovers available app and MCP tools at runtime; pstack does not bundle or require a specific MCP server.

## why are there no planning skills?

codex plan mode works with pstack. if you want a plan, [`$poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) covers it, but planning is not the default.

## make it yours

`poteto-mode` is my style. you may not want exactly that.

type [`$automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md). it mines your recent transcripts, drafts a `<your-name>-mode` skill from how you've actually worked, and routes through pstack underneath. you keep pstack as the base and end up with your own routing skill alongside `poteto-mode`.

models are configurable too. type [`$setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md). it writes `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`, which delegating skills read before spawning agents. absent roles keep their defaults.

## automations

pstack also ships a dormant [benny automation pack](./automations/benny/). benny triages slack issue reports, then reproduces and fixes confirmed bugs with real ui evidence. its files are not registered as slash skills.

to set it up, point Codex at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./automations/benny/FOR_AGENTS.md). setup copies the pack into the target repository at `.codex/automations/benny/`, checks the installed pstack plugin, and creates two idempotent polling automations after explicit approval. user configuration stays outside the copied pack.
