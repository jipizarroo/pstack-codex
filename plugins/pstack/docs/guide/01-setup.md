# Set up pstack

In this page you install the plugin, pick which models pstack uses, and run your first task. Setup is one command plus a short conversation.

## Install the plugin

From a shell, register your clone's marketplace and install:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/pstack-codex
codex plugin add pstack@pstack-codex
```

Start a new Codex task after the CLI confirms installation.

## Pick your models

Run:

```text
$setup-pstack
```

[`$setup-pstack`](../../skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) reads the models exposed by the current Codex host, asks for a reasoning budget, shows each role, and writes `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`.

You only override what you care about. A role with no line in the rule keeps the skill's default. To restore a default, delete that role's line. A rerun of `$setup-pstack` preserves configured role values, including lists and inheritance aliases, unless you choose a replacement. An existing file can pin earlier defaults; delete the corresponding role lines to adopt the current Codex defaults. Setup drops retired role lines and reports them before writing.

You might be wondering what happens if you use Auto. Set a role to `inherit-parent` or `auto` and pstack omits the subagent `model` field, so the subagent inherits your parent chat model. Both values mean the same thing, and neither is a model slug. For a panel role the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, so the list length sets the panel size. Setup also configures `swarm workers`, the default model for every `$swarm` worker unless a race names a model for each arm.

## Accept the verification offer, or don't

At the end of setup, `$setup-pstack` looks for a way to prove app behavior in your project, either a `verify-*` skill or an existing harness. If it finds neither, it offers once to generate one with [`$create-verification-skill`](../../skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md).

Say yes and it writes `.agents/skills/verify-<app>/`, a project-local skill that teaches agents to drive your app the way a user does. It proves the skill works once before handing it over. Say no and setup moves on. You can run `$create-verification-skill` yourself any time. [Verify and ship](./06-verify-and-ship.md#create-a-project-verification-skill) covers when it earns its place.

After setup, start a new task so the custom agents are reloaded.

## Keep the cost in check

pstack spends extra tokens on subagents and review panels. That's the price of the rigor. To spend fewer:

- Rerun `$setup-pstack` and pick a smaller reasoning budget or cheaper models. A strong model in the main chat with cheaper, faster models in the code roles is a good split.
- Set a role to `auto` or `inherit-parent` so it runs on the chat's own model.
- Shorten a panel list. Each entry runs one subagent.
- Save `$poteto-mode` for work that needs rigor. A small, obvious edit doesn't.

## Run your first task

Pick something real but small, and describe it the way you'd describe it to a colleague:

```text
$poteto-mode add a --json flag to this command. text output stays byte-identical. verify both.
```

Watch the todo list. Its first items are the matched playbook's steps copied in, the Feature playbook for this prompt. If `$poteto-mode` skips a step, the step stays in the list with `skip: <reason>`, so you can see what it chose not to do.

For continued use, ask Codex to follow poteto-mode throughout this task. Record that instruction in resume notes. No Cursor-style sticky-mode registration is installed.

Next: [Route work through `$poteto-mode`](./02-poteto-mode.md).
